# Research in Asset Management — Project AM BIZEUL

**How far can mathematical intuition and computational experimentation take us in modern finance?**  
This project is a hands-on, research-oriented exploration of advanced methods in **asset management**, designed to test, visualize, and understand the behavior of complex financial models and quantitative signals.

It blends theory and practice, and proposes a structured way to experiment — like a sandbox for modern portfolio science.

## What this project explores

This notebook is not just another strategy backtest — it is an open-ended **research playground** built around questions like:

- What happens when classical assumptions break?
- How can we design, stress, and iterate on asset signals with minimal noise?
- Can we detect, extract, and **learn from structure** in the market without overfitting?

 Topics explored include:

- Data preprocessing and signal design
- Portfolio construction logic
- Exploratory risk-return analysis
- Evaluation of model robustness
- Impact of tuning parameters on convergence, noise, and stability

## Real-world use case: Why it matters in finance

In asset management, **a wrong assumption costs real money**.  
Research tools like this are vital to:

- Prototype new signals (momentum, volatility, ML-driven alpha)
- Test strategies in non-standard regimes
- Understand model fragility before deployment
- Build confidence in your intuition **before putting capital at risk**

> This kind of framework is what quant teams use to explore strategies before moving to production-level infrastructure.
